  Kola Farms is a locally owned and operated California marijuana dispensary in
  the heart of Boulder. We pride ourselves in growing clean, potent, natural
  Craft Cannabis, for adults 21 and over.



  With the passing of Amendment 64 in November of 2012, Colorado residents made
  it possible for marijuana consumers to exercise their civil liberties and
  legally purchase cannabis flower (buds), extracts and edibles. This legislation
  has allowed for The Farm to fulfill our vision of opening our doors to the
  public and offering some of the highest quality cannabis, vaporizers, and
  accessories available today.



  Our knowledgeable staff is warm, welcoming, and excited to share our passion
  for the end of cannabis prohibition. Here at The Farm, you will find
  a professional, open, and consultative environment. Thank you for taking the
  time to visit our website and we hope to see you soon.
