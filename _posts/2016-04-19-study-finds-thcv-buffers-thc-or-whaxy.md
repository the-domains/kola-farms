description: 'THCV, or tetrahydrocannabivarin, is the molecular cousin to the most famous cannabinoid, THC. It is found mostly in sativa strains of cannabis and, like THC, fits into the same microscopic chemical receptors in the central nervous system and immune system. Unlike THC, THCV is either mildly or not psychoactive and is actually one of the more common cannabinoids.'
